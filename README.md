    <h3>LÁVKA PŘES RENNERŮV POTOK, KRKONOŠE</h3>
    <h3>Propojení lavičky a lávky​</h3>
    <p>Návrh je inspirován atmosférou místa a využívá působivých výhledů v Eliščině údolí. Koncept propojuje lavičku s konstrukcí lávky. Sezení je orientováno tak, aby nabízelo nejlepší výhledy do údolí a na zalesněné kopce v pozadí. Pravá strana lávky je tvarována podle ergonomie sezení, přičemž sezení plynule přechází v ležení, zatímco profil lávky pro průjez zůstává neměnný.</p>
    
    <h3>Vzhled a konstrukce lávky</h3>
    <p>Podoba a konstrukce lávky vycházejí z jejího umístění a specifických podmínek Eliščina údolí. Návrh byl výrazně ovlivněn požadavkem na průjezdnost, což vedlo k rozšíření průřezu na 3,3 metru v jeho nejužším bodě a použití robustních konstrukčních prvků. Konstrukce lávky je tvořena ocelovým lisovaným profilem, který překlenul sedm metrů mezi kamennými pylony na stranách potoka.

    <h3>MUNICIPAL LIBRARY, PRACHATICE</h3>
    <h3>Koncept</h3>
    <p>V projektu se snažím vyvarovat se stejnému osudu, který postihl historické centrum města Prachatic.  Centrum obcházíme a sledujeme místo abychom jej aktivně využívali. Hist. centrum města je skanzen, to je jeho jedinou funkcí. 
        Štěpánčin park dnes využití nemá. Stává se stejným skanzenem. Tedy přidáváme funkci. Procházíme parkem abychom vstoupili do knihovny. Park se zalidňuje, stává se bezpečnějším.</p>

    <h3>Návrh</h3>
    <p>Knihovna, jako objekt v čele parku, je za něj z velké části zodpovědná. Musí s parkem komunikovat. Musí ho  svým způsobem určovat. Návrh dodržuje původní vymezení historické části parku. Objekt ho lemuje a definuje. Prosklená fasáda není jenom prvkem osvětlujícím interiér, ale způsobem interakce a spolupráce těchto činitelů.</p>

    <h3>The Library’s Role and Interaction with the Park</h3>
    <p>The library, as the focal point at the park’s edge, bears significant responsibility for the park. It must communicate with the park and, in a way, shape it. The design adheres to the original boundaries of the historic section of the park. The building borders and defines this space. The glass façade is not just a feature for illuminating the interior; it serves as a means of interaction and cooperation between these elements.</p>

    <h3>UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, MILAN</h3>
    <h3>Proposed design</h3>
    <p>In response to the block‘s historical and current functions, the design introduces a specialized library that provides vital resources for the universities integrated into the existing structure of the block and of the city of Milan. The library is conceived as a hub of knowledge and research, housing extensive collections from the participating universities, the Società Umanitaria, and the ever-growing archives of Milan. In addition to public and specialized reading rooms, the library will offer research facilities, with areas dedicated to the study of historical documents and archival materials.</p>
    
    <p>To support the educational mission of the universities, the project also includes flexible, multi-functional spaces such as seminar rooms and conference areas. These spaces are intended to be rented out to students and faculty, fostering collaboration and offering an accessible venue for lectures, workshops, and academic meetings.</p>
    
    <p>The design further accommodates modern office spaces that serve as startup hubs for recent graduates or students needing a professional base near their university. These offices are designed to promote interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, with direct access to the library and university resources. A significant portion of the building is thus dedicated to supporting the academic and professional growth of the students and recent graduates, making the space not just a repository of knowledge but an active part of the educational ecosystem.</p>

    <h3>PODBĚLOHORSKÁ RESIDENCES, PRAHA</h3>
    <h3>Project Context and Concept</h3>
    <p>The area surrounding our parcel is dominated by Podbělohorská Street, a thoroughfare designed for cars, where the existing development has become fragmented and disconnected. The surrounding, quieter streets have been transformed, turning their backs on Podbělohorská Street. New residential clusters have become increasingly isolated, locked away behind private gates.</p>
    
    <p>Until recently, our parcel was occupied by garages, warehouses, and workshops—some functional, others deteriorating. The complex was inaccessible, fenced off, and closed to the public. As these garages and warehouses are being removed, new construction is planned. This development must rethink the relationship with Podbělohorská Street.</p>
    
    <p>In my project, I intentionally leave a significant portion of the land open and thoughtfully designed, yet minimally defined, allowing it to adapt and respond to future needs. This open space, anchored by a small structure at its edge where it meets Podbělohorská Street, acts as a subtle signal that something is happening here—a point of interest in the landscape.</p>
    
    <p>The design of the proposed buildings is based on rational volumes and comfortable layouts. The structures are oriented to maximize views, relieve the urban density, and emphasize the unique topography of the site. The spaces between the buildings are enhanced with low walls, providing a buffer from the streets, creating a visual connection to the slope, and forming private or communal gardens accessible to all residents. The project anticipates housing 299 residents with 120 parking spaces.</p>

    <h3>REVITALIZATION OF THE OPAVA RIVERFRONT</h3>
    <h3>Pedestrian Connectivity</h3>
    <p>The project introduces a new pedestrian bridge, strategically placed to link both sides of the river and integrate seamlessly into the existing street grid. The design includes improvements to the bridge entrances and the surrounding streetscape, enhancing accessibility and flow. Alongside the bridge, the massing of new buildings along the adjacent streets is carefully considered to align with the surrounding urban context.</p>
    
    <h3>Park Development and School Connection</h3>

    <p>One of the core features is the connection between the local elementary school and the nearby football field, achieved through the creation of a linear park. This space is designed to cater to young athletes, students, and waiting parents, offering recreational and green spaces for the community. A new bridge over the river’s tributary also enhances the connection between these spaces.</p>

    <h3>Promenade and Cycling Path</h3>

    <p>A key element of the project is the design of a continuous riverside promenade and a cycling path. This walkway runs along the banks, allowing for uninterrupted pedestrian and cyclist movement through the town, integrating the waterfront more deeply into the city’s daily life. The promenade is expanded at points to create seating areas, greenery, and „meanders“ where people can gather and relax.</p>

    <h3>Flood Protection and Lower Park Expansion</h3>

    <p>The lower part of the park has been extended to improve flood protection along the riverbank. A carefully designed paved upper park, combined with an orchard, connects the two park levels. The transition between the levels is marked by a cycling path and walking promenade, ensuring smooth movement while also enhancing the park’s visual appeal.5. Integration with the Urban Plan.The project includes the integration of school grounds into the park, enabling future school expansion. The remaining space has been dedicated to a public park. The design adheres to the urban plan’s guidelines for the site, repurposing former garage and garden colony areas for civic and public use.</p>

The design adheres to the urban plan’s guidelines for the site, repurposing former garage and garden colony areas for civic and public use.</p>

    <h3>Contrasting Riverbanks</h3>

    <p>The riverbanks are designed to offer distinct experiences. On one side, a paved embankment hosts urban markets and public events, while the other features a green strip transitioning directly into the river. A narrow fisherman’s path runs through this green belt, adding a natural touch. The riverside wall aligns with the fences of adjacent private properties, lowering to create more openness and interaction with the landscape.</p>

    <h3>Modernist Architecture Meets Nature</h3>

    <p>The revitalized riverfront acts as an extension of the nearby modernist residential areas, establishing a cohesive green corridor that connects these neighborhoods to the river. The park is organized with a clear hierarchy of functions: cycling and pedestrian paths, a network of streets that respond to the surrounding urban fabric, and sloped or flat park areas tailored to various recreational needs.</p>

    <h3>CABIN FOR A COUPLE, PODHRADÍ U AŠE</h3>
    <h3>Design Proposal Summary</h3>
    <p>The objective of this study was to design a minimalist family house on a sloped plot in the village of Podhradí, located in the Sudetes region, 5 km north of Aš, in the Czech Republic. The plot, situated on the edge of the village and near a forest, offers scenic views of the valley. The terrain features two terraces, with the house positioned on the upper one.</p>

    <p>The design consists of a single-story structure with a gabled roof, oriented towards the valley. The layout includes an open-plan living space with a box that houses the entrance, bathroom, technical room, kitchen, and sleeping area in a loft above. The interior is clad in birch plywood with light grey marmoleum flooring, while the exterior features a light beige plaster finish. Windows have matching frames, and the roof is covered with light grey aluminum sheets.</p>

    <h3>COMMUNITY HOUSE, HUMPOLEC</h3>
    <h3>The Project Approach</h3>
    <p>This project centers on the reconstruction and potential extensions of a building complex bounded by Soukenická, Husova, and Smetanova streets, with a southern service link connecting the department store and school. The scope includes the redesign of surrounding public spaces, focusing on the service road and the adjacent eastern park, serving as a key entry point to the event hall.</p>

    <p>The existing school and community center, having undergone various reconstructions—primarily in the 1990s—are a patchwork of different architectural phases. Our approach seeks to preserve the strengths of the original design while removing unnecessary alterations and optimizing functionality. The volumes are unified through a new architectural language, creating a cohesive whole.</p>

    <p>Similarly, the surrounding public space is treated with an eye for urban integration. In collaboration with landscape architects, we have enhanced the existing green infrastructure, forming a promenade that connects key green spaces throughout the city. Perpendicular to this promenade, we introduce a new link between two major squares in Humpolec, aligning new civic amenities along these axes and situating new entrances to complement the layout.</p>

    <h3>ALBRECHTICE NAD VLTAVOU SQUARE</h3>
    <h3>Current state</h3>

<p>The village square currently lacks a defined center and primarily serves as a parking lot and bus turnaround. The proposed design seeks to transform this space into a cohesive, functional public area by unifying fragmented elements and removing barriers.</p>

<h3>The design proposal</h3>

<p>Key to the design is the enhancement of the visual axis toward the church tower, establishing a smooth transition from the urban environment to the natural landscape surrounding the Albrechtický stream.</p>

<p>In the southern section of the square, where the main axes intersect, we propose a central public space—a paved area designed for events and gatherings. This design also includes the removal of the road near František Král’s house, fully integrating it into the square and promoting a sense of community.</p>

<p>To create a more inviting atmosphere, the northern part of the square will be softened with greenery, featuring a terraced seating area shaded by trees. This area will provide a tranquil spot for visitors.</p>

<p>We will also realign the connection between the road and the chapel cemetery, reinforcing the ceremonial path, which is a significant feature of the village. The introduction of tall, solitary trees typical of the region will enhance the visual appeal and create a layered landscape, making the square a vibrant hub for social events and gatherings.</p>

    <h3>TUCHLOVICE SQUARE</h3>
    <h3>Current state</h3>

<p>Tuchlovice Square currently lacks the qualities of a true town center. It fails to support pedestrian flow, cultural events, or function as a cohesive public space. The area, positioned at the intersection of Ke Stráži and Karlovarská streets, suffers from disconnection and inconsistent urban solutions. However, the space offers significant potential.</p>

<h3>The design strategy</h3>

<p>Our design strategy focuses on revitalizing existing layers rather than introducing entirely new ones. We aim to enhance the functional diversity of both sides of Karlovarská street, creating a pedestrian-friendly environment with green spaces and public amenities. The plan introduces better connectivity between key community spaces, such as shops, parks, and recreational areas, while maintaining and integrating mature trees as essential elements of the square‘s character. A new multi-functional structure will combine a bus stop, retail, public restrooms, and event facilities, ensuring the space serves both daily needs and larger town gatherings.</p>

<p>The square’s design emphasizes flexibility, allowing it to host a wide range of community events, from markets to festivals, transforming it into a vibrant and essential public space for Tuchlovice.</p>
